# Compressed Sensing Algorithms
Repository for studying Compressed Sensing algorithms using PyTorch and MATLAB implementations.

OMP Algorithm
Python and MATLAB Implementation
The implementation is done and tested for various values of n(data length), k(sparsity) and m(measurements).
Takeaway: For a certain value of n and k, a minimum m(measurements) is required.
